## 🔭 About Me
Hey everyone! I'm Ana, a software engineer originally from Madrid. While I started off studying telecommunication engineering, my true passion lies in coding and problem-solving. When I'm not diving into the world of tech, you can find me out exploring new places, climbing, or conquering mountains 🧗🏼‍♀️
I firmly believe that combining technology with our core human values can pave the way for a more sustainable and better future. And I'm committed to making that vision a reality!

## 🌱 My mission
In recent years, I've figured out that sticking to solid tech practices can actually mean working less and enjoying life more. Trusting our code and our team is key. Working remotely, I find myself more efficient, sociable, and taking less time to get things done — all thanks to TDD, pairing, feedback, CI/CD, TBD, Agile, and other practices.

And hey, I believe in highlighting the work of women in the tech scene. As a woman and developer 👩🏽‍💻,I'm proud of what I've accomplished both professionally and personally. I'm on a mission to keep pushing for more recognition and respect for women in tech. We've got loads to bring to the table! 💜

## Tech Stack
Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, Spring,React, Mysql, GCP...

## Professional 
Now I am coding at backend and frotnend for Clevergy, trying to make a more sustainable world through energy control. [Take a look !](https://www.clever.gy/)
